# portrait-ipfs-authentication

portrait-ipfs-authentication is a Node.js Express authentication layer for handling authentication by means of ``accessToken`` and ``ethAddress``. The layer acts as a gate between an IPFS node and the web such that no security and networking changes have to be made for the IPFS daemon.
